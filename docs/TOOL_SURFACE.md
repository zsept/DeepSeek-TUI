# Tool surface

Why these specific tools, in this groupings, and how each one is meant to be
chosen over the available shell equivalent. Companion to `crates/tui/src/prompts/agent.txt`.

## Design stance

- **Dedicated tools over `exec_shell` whenever the dedicated tool returns
  structured output.** Bash escaping is error-prone and platform behavior
  varies (GNU vs BSD `grep`, `rg` is not always installed). Structured
  output also frees the model from re-parsing free-form text.
- **`exec_shell` for everything else.** Build, test, format, lint, ad-hoc
  commands, anything platform-specific. We don't try to wrap the long tail.
- **Drop tools that don't beat their shell equivalent.** Two-tool aliases
  for the same backing operation are a model trap — the LLM will alternate
  between them and the cache hit rate suffers.

## Current surface (v0.8.35)

### File operations

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `read_file` | Read a UTF-8 file. PDFs auto-extracted via `pdftotext` (poppler) when available; `pages: "1-5"` slices large docs. |
| `list_dir` | Structured, gitignore-aware listing. Preferred over `exec_shell("ls")`. |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file. |
| `edit_file` | Search-and-replace inside a single file. Cheaper than a full rewrite. |
| `apply_patch` | Apply a unified diff. The right tool for multi-hunk edits. |
| `retrieve_tool_result` | Read summaries or slices of prior large tool outputs spilled to `~/.deepseek/tool_outputs/`; use `summary`, `head`, `tail`, `lines`, or `query` instead of replaying the whole result. |
| `handle_read` | Read bounded projections from `var_handle` payloads held by live tool environments. This is the foundation for RLM sessions, agent transcripts, and other large symbolic payloads. |

### Search

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `grep_files` | Regex search file contents within the workspace; structured matches + context lines. Pure-Rust (`regex` crate), no `rg`/`grep` shell-out. |
| `file_search` | Fuzzy-match filenames (not contents). Use when you know roughly the name. |
| `web_search` | Bing by default; DuckDuckGo, Tavily, and Bocha are selectable in config. Ranked snippets + `ref_id` for citation. |
| `fetch_url` | Direct HTTP GET on a known URL. Faster than `web_search` when the link is already known. HTML stripped to text by default. |

### Shell

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `exec_shell` | Run a shell command. Foreground runs are cancellable, but use them only for bounded commands; timeout kills the process and returns a background-rerun hint. |
| `exec_shell_wait` | Poll a background task for incremental output. Canceling the turn stops waiting without killing the task. |
| `exec_shell_interact` | Send stdin to a running background task and read incremental output. |
| `exec_shell_cancel` | Cancel one running background shell task by id, or all running background shell tasks when explicitly requested. |
| `task_shell_start` | Start a long-running command in the background and return immediately. Preferred over foreground shell for diagnostics, tests, searches, and servers that may run for minutes. |
| `task_shell_wait` | Poll a background command. If `gate` is supplied after completion, record structured gate evidence on the active durable task. |

When a foreground shell command times out, the process is not continued
silently. The tool result tells the model to rerun long work with
`task_shell_start` or `exec_shell` with `background = true`, then poll with
`task_shell_wait` or `exec_shell_wait`.

Interactive shell jobs are also visible through `/jobs`. The TUI job center is
fed by the same shell manager as `exec_shell`/`task_shell_start`, and shows the
command, cwd, elapsed time, status, output tail, process-local shell id, and
linked durable task id when available. `/jobs show`, `/jobs poll`, `/jobs wait`,
`/jobs stdin`, and `/jobs cancel` provide inspect, polling, stdin, and cancel
controls for live jobs. Jobs are process-local; after restart, live process
state is not reattached, and any remembered detached entries must be marked
stale rather than presented as live processes.

### MCP manager and palette discovery

MCP server configuration is surfaced in the TUI through `/mcp` and the
`mcp_config_path` row in `/config`. `/mcp` shows the resolved config path,
server enabled/disabled state, transport, command or URL, timeouts, connection
errors, and discovered tools/resources/prompts. It supports narrow manager
actions for init, add, enable, disable, remove, validate, and reload/reconnect.
Config edits are written immediately, but the model-visible MCP tool pool is
restart-required after edits.

The command palette includes MCP entries grouped by server. Disabled and failed
servers stay visible, and discovered tools/prompts use the runtime names shown
to the model, such as `mcp_<server>_<tool>`.

### Git / diagnostics / testing

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `git_status` | Inspect repo status without running shell. |
| `git_diff` | Inspect working-tree or staged diffs. |
| `diagnostics` | Workspace, git, sandbox, and toolchain info in one call. |
| `run_tests` | `cargo test` with optional args. |

### Task management and durable work

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `update_plan` | Structured checklist for complex multi-step work. |
| `task_create` | Create/enqueue a durable background task through `TaskManager`. This is the real executable work object for long-running agent work. |
| `task_list` | List durable tasks with status and linked runtime ids. |
| `task_read` | Read durable task detail: thread/turn linkage, timeline, checklist, gates, artifacts, PR attempts, GitHub events. |
| `task_cancel` | Cancel a queued or running durable task. Approval-required. |
| `checklist_write` | Granular progress under the active thread/task. Checklist state is subordinate to the durable task. |
| `checklist_add` / `checklist_update` / `checklist_list` | Single-item checklist operations. |
| `todo_write` / `todo_add` / `todo_update` / `todo_list` | Compatibility aliases for the checklist tools. Existing sessions keep working, but new prompts should use `checklist_*`. |
| `note` | One-off important fact for later. |

### Verification gates and artifacts

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `task_gate_run` | Run an approved verification command and attach structured evidence to the active durable task: command, cwd, exit code, duration, classification, summary, and log artifact. |

Large logs and command outputs should be artifacts with compact summaries in the transcript. `task_gate_run` handles this automatically for active durable tasks.

### GitHub context and guarded writes

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `github_issue_context` | Read-only issue context via `gh issue view`; large bodies become task artifacts when possible. |
| `github_pr_context` | Read-only PR context via `gh pr view`; optional diff capture via `gh pr diff --patch`; large bodies/diffs become task artifacts when possible. |
| `github_comment` | Approval-required issue/PR comment with structured evidence. |
| `github_close_issue` | Approval-required issue closure. Requires non-empty acceptance criteria and evidence; refuses dirty worktrees unless explicitly allowed. Never close an issue merely because an agent is stopping. |

### PR attempts

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `pr_attempt_record` | Capture the current git diff as attempt metadata plus a patch artifact on a durable task. |
| `pr_attempt_list` | List attempts recorded on a task. |
| `pr_attempt_read` | Inspect one recorded attempt and its artifact reference. |
| `pr_attempt_preflight` | Run `git apply --check` against an attempt patch. No worktree mutation. |

### Automations

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `automation_create` | Create a scheduled automation. Approval-required. |
| `automation_list` / `automation_read` | Inspect durable automations and recent runs. |
| `automation_update` | Update prompt, schedule, cwds, or status. Approval-required. |
| `automation_pause` / `automation_resume` / `automation_delete` | Lifecycle controls. Approval-required. |
| `automation_run` | Run an automation now; the run enqueues a normal durable task. Approval-required. |

### Agents

v0.8.33 began moving large tool outputs toward symbolic handles: tools return
small `var_handle` objects, and `handle_read` retrieves bounded slices, counts,
or JSON projections from the backing environment. This keeps the parent
transcript small while preserving a recovery path to the full payload.

The active model-facing agent surface is persistent and intentionally small:

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `agent_open` | Open a named agent session for independent work. Returns a session projection immediately so the parent can keep coordinating. |
| `agent_eval` | Send follow-up input, block for completion, or fetch the current projection/transcript handle for an existing session. |
| `agent_close` | Cancel or release a agent session by name or id. |

See `agent.txt` for the delegation protocol and
[`AGENT_ROLES.md`](AGENT_ROLES.md) for the role taxonomy
(`general` / `explore` / `plan` / `review` / `implementer` /
`verifier` / `custom`).

`agent_open` defaults to a fresh child conversation. Pass
`fork_context: true` for continuation-style work or multi-perspective reviews
that should inherit the parent's context. In fork mode, the runtime preserves
the parent prefill/prompt prefix byte-identically where available so DeepSeek's
prefix cache can be reused, then appends the child role instructions and task.

### Recursive LM sessions

RLM is now persistent as well:

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `rlm_open` | Open a named Python REPL over a file, inline content, or URL. |
| `rlm_eval` | Run bounded Python against that session, using deterministic code and in-REPL semantic helpers such as `sub_query_batch`. |
| `rlm_configure` | Adjust output feedback, child-query timeout/depth, and session-sharing settings. |
| `rlm_close` | Shut down the Python runtime and return final session stats. |

Large RLM outputs should come back as `var_handle`s. Use `handle_read` for
bounded text slices, line ranges, counts, or JSONPath projections instead of
replaying the full value into the parent transcript.

Inside `rlm_eval`, the loaded source is available as `_context`; `content` is
also bound as a convenience alias because agents naturally reach for it during
Python analysis. The shorter `context` and `ctx` names are intentionally not
bound so user variables can use them without colliding with the bootstrap.

Child-call timeouts are session policy: use `rlm_configure` with
`sub_query_timeout_secs` before running a large fan-out. The helpers
`sub_query`, `sub_query_batch`, `sub_query_map`, and `sub_rlm` accept a
`timeout_secs` keyword for compatibility with common agent guesses, but the
effective timeout remains configured at the RLM session level.

`finalize(value, confidence=...)` preserves JSON-serializable values. Strings
become text handles; dicts, lists, numbers, booleans, and null become JSON
handles that `handle_read` can project with JSONPath.

### Session relay

`/relay [focus]` asks the current agent to write `.deepseek/handoff.md` as a
compact `# Session relay` artifact for the next thread. The filename remains
for compatibility with existing prompt loading and older sessions; the visible
mental model is relay / 接力.

Aliases: `/batonpass`, `/接力`.

Use it before a long break, compaction, or moving work to a fresh session. The
relay should preserve the goal, current Work checklist item, changed files,
decisions, verification state, and one concrete next action.

### Parallel fan-out: cost-class caps

Two tools offer parallel fan-out with different concurrency limits that
reflect very different cost classes:

| Tool | What each child does | Wall-clock | Token cost | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent_open` | Full agent loop (planning, tool calls, multi-turn streaming, can open children) | minutes | thousands of tokens | 10 in flight by default (`[agents].max_concurrent`, hard ceiling 20) |
| `rlm_eval` helper `sub_query_batch` | One-shot non-streaming Chat Completions calls pinned to `deepseek-v4-flash` inside a live RLM session | seconds | ~hundreds of tokens | 16 per call |

The caps appear in each tool's description and error messages so the model
(and the user) can choose the right tool for the job. If one agent is
enough but you need parallel semantic lookups over the same loaded context,
prefer `rlm_eval` with `sub_query_batch`; if each task needs its own
tool-carrying agent loop, use `agent_open` and close completed sessions to free
slots.

## Removed legacy aliases and surfaces

v0.8.33 removed the old model-facing agent fan-out surface from active
prompting and tool catalogs. Do not use these names in new active guidance:
`agent_spawn`, `agent_wait`, `agent_result`, `agent_send_input`,
`agent_assign`, `agent_resume`, `agent_list`, `spawn_agent`,
`delegate_to_agent`, `send_input`, and `close_agent`.

The old one-shot `rlm` model-facing tool is also replaced by persistent
`rlm_open` / `rlm_eval` / `rlm_configure` / `rlm_close` sessions.

Historical compatibility results may include a `_deprecation` block shaped
like this:

```json
{
  "_deprecation": {
    "this_tool": "spawn_agent",
    "use_instead": "agent_open",
    "removed_in": "0.8.33",
    "message": "Tool 'spawn_agent' is deprecated; switch to 'agent_open'."
  }
}
```

This is a legacy/compatibility note, not the active recommended surface.

## Release smoke: verify the live names

When validating a release, verify the model-visible registry names directly.
Do not grep random handler function names; handler names are allowed to drift
while the registry contract stays stable.

Version smoke:

```bash
deepseek --version
deepseek-tui --version
```

Tool-surface smoke:

```bash
rg -n '"handle_read"|"rlm_open"|"rlm_eval"|"rlm_configure"|"rlm_close"|"agent_open"|"agent_eval"|"agent_close"' crates/tui/src
rg -n 'handle_read|rlm_open|rlm_eval|rlm_configure|rlm_close|agent_open|agent_eval|agent_close' docs crates/tui/src/prompts crates/tui/src/tools
```

The canonical v0.8.35 live names are:

- `handle_read`
- `rlm_open`, `rlm_eval`, `rlm_configure`, `rlm_close`
- `agent_open`, `agent_eval`, `agent_close`

The registry should not actively advertise the legacy one-shot names
`agent_spawn`, `agent_wait`, `agent_result`, or the old foreground `rlm` tool
outside legacy/removal notes. Historical changelog entries and compatibility
code may still mention them.

## Why we don't ship a single `bash` tool

Single-`bash` agents (Claude Code's design) are powerful but hand the model
all the foot-guns of shell scripting: quoting, platform divergence,
side-effects from misread cwd, `cd` not persisting between calls, etc. Our
file tools are also significantly cheaper to render in the transcript
(structured JSON-shaped output collapses better than `ls -la` walls of text).

The model can always fall back to `exec_shell` when something is missing.
The dedicated tools just take the common 80% off the shell escape-hatch.
